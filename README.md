seniorDesignApp
===============

This was an iOS application written for my senior design project.  Our team created a customizable lighting system that
reacts to ambient lighting and the user's presence to conserve electricity.  The iOS app allowed the user to manually
control the lights, change lighting settings, set light timers, create lighting presets, view energy consumption and
savings, etc.  

The app was never 100% complete and is currently in a semi-working state as changes have been made since the class.
